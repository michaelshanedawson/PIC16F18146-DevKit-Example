## PIC16F18146-DevKit-Example ##
A basic starter MPLAB X IDE project for the PIC16F18146-I/SO development kit that I have designed and built to make it easier to integrate this MCU into projects. The datasheet can be found here: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/PIC16F18126_46_Microcontrollers_Data_Sheet_DS40002-3010025.pdf

Driver for the Silicone Labs USB to UART bridge chip can be found here: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
